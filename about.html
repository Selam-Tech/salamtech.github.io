                    Hi, I’m  selamawit Mekbib a 4th-year Computer Science undergraduate student at Unity University, Ethiopia.
I’m passionate about technology, human behavior, and how innovation can transform lives and societies.<br>
I grew up as the youngest child in my family, with three sisters and one brother, and I’ve always been known as the fastest learner and the most creative one at home. That environment shaped me into someone who is curious, observant, and always ready to explore new ideas.
Throughout my academic journey from elementary school to high school and now university I have consistently been recognized as a top performing, creative, and driven student. I enjoy challenging myself and pushing beyond expectations, both academically and personally.
I also have experience in the marketing industry, working closely with different professionals and personal development trainers. This experience strengthened my communication skills, emotional intelligence, and understanding of the human mindset.
Combined with my academic background, all of this deepened my interest in Artificial Intelligence and advanced technology especially how technology can understand, support, and amplify human potential.
The world is evolving, and I want to be part of the generation shaping that future.
